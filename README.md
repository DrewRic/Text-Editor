## Description

This project is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) text editor that can run directly in the browser. It is a single-page application (SPA) designed to work both online and offline. The text editor leverages IndexedDB for data storage, allowing users to create and save notes or code snippets that can be retrieved even without an internet connection. The application meets all PWA criteria, including offline functionality, and can be installed as a desktop application.

The text editor is built using modern JavaScript bundled with Webpack, and it uses the idb package for efficient IndexedDB interactions. The application is deployed to Render.

## Useage

Once the server is running, you can access the text editor in your browser. Add notes or code snippets in the editor, and the content will be saved automatically using IndexedDB. You can close and reopen the app, and your saved content will be retrieved from the database. The app works both online and offline, and you can install it as a desktop app by clicking the Install button.
